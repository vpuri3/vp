# Hi, I'm Vedant

I like to solve partial differential equations in interesting geometries, often with powerful supercomputers. *Why*, you ask? Because everybody needs a hobby. JK, it's partly for the aesthetic pleasure of looking at cool visualizations and intricate patterns of tubrulent flows, and partly because it's useful to other folks in engineering. It's just a fun mathematical problem to spend your time on.

I write experimental (read, absolute whack) algorithms for solving PDE models that describe physics of fluid flow, battery dynamics, heat conduction, and the like. I just create tooling for other people doing more practical work in the hope that some of the stuff I put out will be useful to them.

To connect, you can email me at [vedantpuri@gmail.com](mailto:vedantpuri@gmail.com), or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vpuri3/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vponduty/) where I periodically post work-visualizations. Check out my [Github](https://github.com/vpuri3) for recent contributions.

**LinkedIn bio** - Trained in applied mechanics, and mathematics, with experience in high performance computing, numerical algorithms, scientific machine learning, and computational fluid dynamics. Equally comfortable writing code or manipulating differential equations. Finished undergraduate studies at University of Illinois in Dec '19. My thesis was on wall-bounded turbulence with collaborators from Argonne National Lab. Currently working on scientific machine learning and numerical PDEs at Julia Computing.

**TLDR** - I make cool visualizations on supercomputers.

# Not work
**Sports** - I play squash, soccer, and golf.

**Photography** - For the past decade, I have been using a Canon 550D with a 50mm lens as an excuse to walk around and photograph people.  Check out [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128280868@N05/) work in progress portfolio.

**Books** - Besides mathematics, I read at the intersection of pragmatic nonfiction and cerebral philosophy. I always find a way to collect books, even when I am living out of a suitcase. It's a problem! Some authors that have impacted my worldview are, in this order, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Fydor Dostoyvesky, Jordan Peterson, John Steinbeck, and Milan Kundera. Note to self: write down reading list.

**Films** - I am a sucker for quality storytelling. Check out my watch-list here. Note to self: write down watch list.
